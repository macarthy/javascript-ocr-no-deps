There are a few whys to approch this but I want to do with ANY external dependencys: 

- so some smart filtering 
- a neaural net from the ground up (low test data)
- maybe a I can generate a ton of data from dictionary and use the target FONT
- some ALGOs to bounding box the chars 
- other ocr stuff I know from OpenCV 



// Process the 0123456789.png 
// build an signature for each letter 
// some sort of delta in found chars 
// function to display the image for debugging
